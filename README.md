Django-soap-webservice
======================

A demo of django webservice，use soap message and wsdl.


_require：_
Django (1.5.5)
soaplib (2.0.0-beta2)


This is just a simple demo, you can use "git clone" or download zip file.

Just other django project , just use "python manage.py runserver"
And open the browser "url", you can get the wsdl file.

I will write a soap client in tests folder, you can just use python execute it.
